Do it right the first time. Take the time to do it right now vs borrowing time from the future to do it quick and easy now. We pride ourselves on our resilient codebase, and applaud ourselves when we don't try and hack it into submission.
Legendary Reliability: Your logic must be flawless. Every move, terrain interaction, and state transition must be mathematically sound.
Simplicity is Mastery: Do not overengineer. Break complex tactical problems into small, single-purpose, maintainable chunks.
MVC Architecture: Strictly follow Model-View-Controller patterns. Logic belongs in hooks (Controllers), state in G/ctx (Model), and composition in View files (View).
Legacy Code: Code for the future. Use abstractions that last, but keep implementations lean and "oiled."
Stay absolutely away from setTimeout and setInterval to mitigate memory leak risks.
