Atoms: Single elements only.
Molecules/Organisms: No raw HTML elements. Use Tailwind utilities exclusively.
Atoms for single elements.
Molecules for groups of atoms.
Organisms for groups of atoms and molecules too.
Templates made up of organisms and sometimes molecules too.
Views make use of templates.
I don't want to see raw html elements in molecules, organisms, or groups.
Use tailwind utilities to keep styles global and reusable as easy to recognize.
